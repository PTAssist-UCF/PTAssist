# Backend

FastAPI service. It is the only entry point into PTAssist: the frontend talks only to this API, and only this API talks to the database, storage, and AI service.

## Stack

FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, PostgreSQL (psycopg 3 driver), pytest, ruff. Runtime dependencies in `requirements.txt`; test and lint tools in `requirements-dev.txt`.

## Layout

```
app/
  main.py    Creates the FastAPI app and includes the routers
  config.py  Settings from environment variables
  db.py      SQLAlchemy engine and the get_db session dependency
  routes/    HTTP endpoints, grouped by area
  schemas/   Request and response models (Pydantic)
  models/    Database tables (SQLAlchemy). Base class in base.py
  auth/      Clerk token check, current user, role and ownership checks
  storage/   One module for video storage (MinIO locally, Azure Blob in the cloud)
  jobs/      Background task that calls the AI service
migrations/  Alembic migrations (versions/ holds one file per migration)
tests/
alembic.ini  Alembic settings
Dockerfile   API image, also used to run migrations
```

## Run locally

Needs Python 3.12. Run these from `backend/`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

uvicorn app.main:app --reload    # http://localhost:8000/health and /docs
pytest
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
```

`GET /health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`. It needs no token and does not touch the database, so Docker and Azure can use it as a liveness probe.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t ptassist-api backend      # from the repo root
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 -e DATABASE_URL=<url> ptassist-api
```

The same image runs migrations: `docker run --rm -e DATABASE_URL=<url> ptassist-api alembic upgrade head`.

## Migrations

Alembic reads `DATABASE_URL` from the environment (it is not stored in `alembic.ini`).

```bash
alembic upgrade head                                   # apply all migrations
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add user table"    # create a new one
```

To add a table: create the model in `app/models/`, import it in `app/models/__init__.py` (so autogenerate can see it), then run `alembic revision --autogenerate`. Always read the generated file before committing. New migrations are linted and formatted with ruff automatically. Constraint and index names follow the naming convention in `app/models/base.py`.

## Every request

1. Verify the Clerk token. No valid token means `401`.
2. Load the user from our `User` table. First call from a new user creates them as a patient.
3. Check the role (patient or therapist). Wrong role means `403`.
4. Check ownership: patients see only their own data, therapists see only linked patients. Not yours means `404`.

Roles live in our database, not in Clerk. Therapists are promoted by the team with a script.

## Data model

| Table | Holds |
| --- | --- |
| `User` | Clerk id, email, role (`patient` or `therapist`) |
| `TherapistPatient` | Which therapist is linked to which patient |
| `Exercise` | The exercise library (5 exercises for the proof of concept) |
| `Plan` | A therapist's plan for one patient |
| `PlanExercise` | An exercise in a plan, with targets (reps, sets, frequency) |
| `Session` | One uploaded video for a plan exercise, with status |
| `SessionResult` | The AI result for a session (JSONB) |

The schema changes only through Alembic migrations. Never edit the database by hand, and never change a migration after it is merged.

## Session lifecycle

```
upload -> processing -> complete
                     -> failed (with a reason)
```

1. `POST` upload: validate the file, store it, create the `Session` as `processing`.
2. A FastAPI background task creates a 15-minute read link and calls the AI service `POST /analyze`.
3. The result is saved to `SessionResult` and the status becomes `complete`, or `failed` if anything goes wrong.
4. Sessions stuck in `processing` too long are marked `failed`.

The frontend polls the session status. Later, a job queue can replace the background task without changing the API.

## Endpoints (draft)

Final paths are decided in each task.

| Area | Endpoint | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Me | `GET /me` | Anyone signed in |
| Exercises | `GET /exercises` | Anyone signed in |
| Patients | `GET/POST/DELETE /therapist/patients` | Therapist |
| Plans | `POST/PUT /plans`, `GET /plans/me` | Therapist, patient |
| Sessions | `POST /sessions`, `GET /sessions/{id}`, `GET /sessions` | Patient (therapist can read linked patients') |
| Progress | `GET /patients/{id}/progress` | Therapist |

## Storage

All video access goes through `app/storage/`. Buckets are private. Other code never talks to MinIO or Azure Blob directly, and never makes a file public. Raw videos are deleted after 30 days.

## Config

Read from environment variables (see `/.env.example`): database URL, Clerk settings, storage settings, and the AI service URL. No secrets in code. Settings are defined in `app/config.py`. Add new ones there and in `/.env.example`.

`DATABASE_URL` must use the `postgresql+psycopg://` scheme so SQLAlchemy picks the psycopg 3 driver.

## Testing

pytest. Every route needs a test that rejects the wrong role and the wrong owner.

## Pull request CI

The shared workflow in `/.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml` runs on every pull request,
including documentation-only changes, so required checks are never skipped by a
path filter. It provides three checks:

- `API lint`: ruff lint and formatting checks.
- `API tests`: pytest with Python 3.12 and `requirements-dev.txt`.
- `API image build`: builds `backend/Dockerfile` without pushing an image.

The workflow uses read-only repository permissions and needs no repository secrets.
The current health test needs no database. Add database setup to the test job when
database integration tests are introduced. The AI team can add its own job to this
workflow in SCRUM-26 without renaming the API checks.

### Required checks on main

A repository administrator must configure this in GitHub; the workflow file alone
does not block merges. After this workflow has run on a pull request:

1. In **Settings > Branches**, add or update a branch protection rule for `main`.
2. Require a pull request before merging and at least **1 approving review**.
3. Require status checks before merging and select `API lint`, `API tests`, and
   `API image build` from GitHub Actions.
4. Require branches to be up to date before merging and enable **Do not allow
   bypassing the above settings**. Keep force pushes and branch deletion disabled.
5. Save the rule. On a disposable PR, introduce a lint or test failure and confirm
   GitHub blocks merging; fix it and confirm all three checks pass. Approval is
   still required before merging.

SCRUM-22 is complete only after the checks run on GitHub and the protection rule
is verified. Keep the check names stable because branch protection refers to them.
